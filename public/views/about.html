     <p> Rosalia Vila Tobella (born 25 September 1992), known mononymously as Rosalía (Spanish: [rosaˈlia] or Catalan: [ruzə'liə]), is a Spanish singer and songwriter. After discovering Spanish folk music at an early age, Rosalía graduated from Catalonia College of Music with honors by virtue of her collaborative cover album with Raül Refree, Los Ángeles (2017), and the baccalaureate project El Mal Querer (2018), which is co-produced by El Guincho and reimagines flamenco by mixing it with pop and urban music. Spawning singles like "Malamente", it caught the attention of the Spanish general public, and was released to universal critical acclaim. Recipient of the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year and listed in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, El Mal Querer started the ascent of Rosalía into the international music scene.

        Her first international hit single was her 2019 collaboration with J Balvin, "Con Altura", a reggaeton track that marked Rosalía's journey to urbano music. Selling over seven million copies, it was named one of the best songs of the year by Billboard and Pitchfork, Best Urban Song by the Latin Recording Academy. She later collaborated with other musicians such as Bad Bunny, Ozuna, Arca and Travis Scott, achieving multiple accolades. Rosalía ventured into avant Latin music with third studio album Motomami, departing from the new flamenco sound of its predecessor. The album achieved global success with its singles "La Fama" and "Saoko" while also becoming the best reviewed and most discussed album of the year on Metacritic.
        
        Throughout her career, Rosalía has accumulated nine number-one singles in her home country. She has also won a Grammy Award, eight Latin Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award, two UK Music Video Awards and two Premio Ruido awards, among others. In 2019, Billboard gave her the Rising Star Award for "changing the sound of today's mainstream music with her fresh flamenco-influenced pop",[18] and she became the first Spanish-singing act in history to be nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys.

    <h2>Life and career</h2>
    <h4>1993–2016: Early life and career beginnings</h4> 
    <p>Rosalía was born on 25 September 1993 and raised in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, a small town in northern Barcelona. She is the youngest daughter of Pilar Tobella, a businesswoman who has been running the family company for decades. Her father, José Manuel Vila, was born in Cudillero, Asturias. They separated in 2019. She has an older sister, Pilar "Pili" Vila, who works with Rosalía as her stylist and creative director. Rosalía expressed interest in the performing arts at an early age especially after discovering the discography of Camarón de la Isla. She began her professional musical education at the age of 16 at the Taller de Músics [es]. She did a six-year course at the academy. She began attending class at the Raval school but, due to her high grades and multiple recommendations, she transferred to the Superior School of Music of Catalonia in order to finish her studies. She also autonomously worked as an independent singer in weddings and musical bars, for which she was paid "a little over 80 euros or exchanging the work for dinner". During that time, Rosalía met many underground Spanish artists who would later succeed such as La Zowi, Yung Beef, Kaydy Cain, Hinds and María Escarmiento.

        At 15, she competed on the television show Tú Sí Que Vales, although she wasn't selected. In 2012 she became the vocalist of Kejaleo, a flamenco music group featuring Jordi Franco, Roger Blavia, Cristo Fontecilla, Diego Cortés and Xavi Turull. They released an album, Alaire, in 2013. That same year, Rosalía professionally worked as a duo with Juan "Chicuelo" Gómez to promote the Blancanieves soundtrack at the 2013 Panama International Film Festival in substitution of Sílvia Pérez Cruz and at the Festival Grec de Barcelona for the contemporary dance work De Carmen. In 2013, she participated in the Association of Performing Arts Professionals (APAP) Conference in New York, and was the lead voice in the culmination of the Any Espriu 2014 at the Palau de la Música. In 2015 she collaborated with La Fura dels Baus on a show that premiered in Singapore. She was the opening act for flamenco artist Miguel Poveda, accompanied by Alfredo Lagos, at the International Music Festival of Cadaqués, and also at the 2016 Jerez Jazz Festival. She worked with Rocío Márquez on the presentation of her album El Niño, produced by Raül Refree, at Primavera Sound. In 2015, she also worked with clothing brand Desigual and sang the single for their campaign jingle "Last Night Was Eternal". and self-released "Un Millón de Veces" included in the benefit album Tres Guitarras Para el Autismo. At 20, she worked as a flamenco teacher and vocal coach.
        
        In 2016, Rosalía collaborated with Spanish rapper and former boyfriend C. Tangana on "Antes de Morirme". The song was a sleeper hit and entered the Spanish Singles Chart in 2018, after the success of Rosalía's newer work. The collaboration received international attention when it was featured on the soundtrack of the first season of Spanish Netflix show Élite.
